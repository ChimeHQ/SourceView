# SourceView
A TextKit 2 view built specifically to work with source code

This project is an experiment to see if it is actually even possible to use NSTextView + TextKit 2. Prior to macOS 14, the combination had major usability issues. However, it is starting to see like it may be ok and I figured it was work at least trying.

## Contributing and Collaboration

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.

## Suggestions and Feedback

I'd love to hear from you! Get in touch via an issue or pull request.
